## Description
  A banking application demonstrating one potential implementation of hash algorithms and symmetric key
  cryptography. This app is not cryptographically secure, and in its present state is vulnerable to many different potential attacks.

  The website's name derives firstly from an early pioneer of hash coding, Hans Peter Luhn. Luhn invented a device for textile thread-counts termed a Lunometer. Since I have an interest in both computer science and textiles, it seemed fitting to name the website in honor of this joint interest of ours, abbreviating it to "Lunome" (source for information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Peter_Luhn).

  As for the "Q" portion of the website, it refers to the implementation of the Queue ADT within this application. Specifically, the Queue takes the form of a Linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) used for the generation of each user's session key.

## Future Improvements
  The list of potential improvements to this app is limitless. Some positive changes would include:
  * Move all the major security algorithms (salting, hashing, session key generation) to a separate Java layer and keep them private
  * Add a SQL database layer for user credentials, balances, etc.
  * Enforce stricter password/username requirements
  * Create separate admin/server dashboard
  * Expand user dashboard to include budget tab, chart of expenditures over time, and more
